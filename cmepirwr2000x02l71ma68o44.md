We began our journey just under three months ago, and we’re thrilled to have successfully organized our second **ML Saturday**—a monthly online event connecting AI/ML enthusiasts across Bangladesh with industry professionals.

ML Saturday is an **open-for-all Q&A session** that provides a valuable space for community members to ask questions directly to experienced mentors and professionals working in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Our **second event took place on May 10, 2025, from** 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM and welcomed **over 40 participants** from diverse academic and professional backgrounds. Our host and mentor, [**Md. Taufiqul Haque Khan Tusar**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taufiq-khan-tusar/), warmly welcomed everyone and introduced both the **mentor panel** and the **volunteer team**—the driving force behind this growing community.

## **Key Discussions**

Following the opening remarks, we dove straight into the main session. For nearly two hours, participants engaged in vibrant and insightful conversations, asking thoughtful questions and receiving practical advice from our mentors. Topics ranged from career guidance and research opportunities to tools, project ideas, and best practices in AI/ML.

Some standout discussions included below.

### **Debashish Roy is learning Python libraries for data science and asked what steps to take next.**

[**Md. Abdur Rakib Mollah**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdurrakibmollah/) advised first deciding whether to pursue an academic or industry path. Also for industry, startups and established companies often have different expectations. As a first-year undergrad, Debashish was encouraged to browse job listings on LinkedIn, identify required skills, and create a personalized roadmap based on that.

### **Abir Ehsan Evan is currently doing internship as an NLP engineer, he asked about the future of the role and whether he should explore other ML domains.**

[**Majidul Islam**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/majidulislammurad/) emphasized that understanding the fundamentals helps solve problems faster. Evan was encouraged to explore generative AI and work on personal projects. Majidul suggested learning data-driven AI, understanding how models work, and focusing on core ML fundamentals to improve performance in future job interviews.

### **Tanzim Shahriya, an HSC 2026 candidate learning ML through the Ostad Platform. He’s interested in studying ML abroad but is unsure whether to pursue CSE or focus directly on an AI/ML program.**

[**Majidul Islam**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/majidulislammurad/) said that you don’t necessarily need to major in AI to work in AI—many successful practitioners come from statistics or other backgrounds. University degrees provide only the basics; deep learning comes from self-study. Either CSE or AI is fine—what matters most is how well you learn.

### **Mohammad Hasan Imon asked what kind of projects freshers should focus on for internships and resumes. Should they go for GenAI or Agentic AI projects?**

[**Majidul Islam**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/majidulislammurad/) said that working on basic projects using popular libraries and existing models is good enough. YouTube-based, step-by-step project tutorials can be helpful. Suggested areas include health tech and time-series data. In interviews, expect questions on how ML models and AI tools like ChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini work.

### **An user named "Common Things" has been working on ML, DL, and NLP, but the concepts aren’t sticking. What should he do?**

[**Md. Abdur Rakib Mollah**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdurrakibmollah/) suggested to start with a solid grasp of statistics fundamentals—this is key to understanding ML. He recommended taking Andrew Ng’s basic ML course on Coursera. [**Md. Taufiqul Haque Khan Tusar**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taufiq-khan-tusar/) also suggested the *100 Days of Machine Learning* playlist by CampusX on YouTube.

### **Moin Uddin Chishti wants to learn deeply about Transformer models and manipulate it.**

[**Md. Abdur Rakib Mollah**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdurrakibmollah/) recommended the **3Blue1Brown** YouTube channel and Transformers lessons of Andrej Karpathy. He also suggested using ChatGPT to break down and understand core concepts interactively. [**Md. Taufiqul Haque Khan Tusar**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taufiq-khan-tusar/) suggested reading the ***Attention Is All You Need*** research paper. If it is too difficult to understand then read the book ***Natural Language Processing with Transformers*** by L. Tunstall—especially Chapters 1, 3, and 10.

### **Anisur Rahman asked that can one learn Computer Vision and NLP together? Can skills in one be applied to the other? Also, How to start reseach as a beginner?**

**Answer by** [**Mansura Naznine**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mansura-naznine/): Yes, you can learn both if you're interested. While some companies have specific requirements, in most cases ML engineers are expected to have broad knowledge, so experience in one domain often helps in another. She also answered a second question: To start research, learn Python, pick a domain, and start reading recent papers. Extract insights, narrow down your focus, and identify a fixed topic for deeper exploration.

### **Minhajul Haque had a several questions: (1) How do the maths behind ML models actually work? (2) Which language to pick—Python or R? I’ve been learning Python for the last 6 months but I’m still not confident. What should I do? (3) How effective is a website portfolio in interviews, and how can I make one if I don’t have web development skills?**

[**Mansura Naznine**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mansura-naznine/) explained how the math works behind the scenes using examples of SVM and CNN algorithms. [**Md. Taufiqul Haque Khan Tusar**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taufiq-khan-tusar/) answered other 2 questions: A personal website showcasing your work makes a strong first impression. Even simple GitHub Pages using ready-made templates can do the job—you don’t need to learn front-end development. Between Python and R, Python is better for industry and machine learning. It takes time to become proficient in Python. To practice more, try solving problems using Python. He recommended HackerRank’s Python problem set.

## **Conclusion**

This session was full of curiosity, learning, and shared knowledge. Whether you're just starting out or already on your journey, ML Saturday is your space to learn, ask, and grow with the community.
